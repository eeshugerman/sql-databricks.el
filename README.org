* sql-databricks.el
** intro
   This package extends Emacs' built-in =sql= package with support for
   [[https://www.databricks.com/product/databricks-sql][Databricks SQL]]. For
   now it merely wires-up =sql-interactive-mode= to
   [[https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-sql-cli.html][the official CLI client]].
   Contributions (perhaps adding other functionality, such as improved
   font-locking) are welcome.

** installation
*** databricks-sql-cli
    To use the =sql-interactive-mode= support, first
    [[https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-sql-cli.html#install-the-databricks-sql-cli][install the Databricks SQL CLI]].

*** this package
    This package is not yet available from MELPA or ELPA. Instead, you may
    install it directly from [[https://github.com/eeshugerman/sql-databricks.el][the GitHub repo]]. Here's one way to do that:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (package-vc-install "https://github.com/eeshugerman/sql-databricks.el")
      (require 'sql-databricks)
    #+end_src
    Other (more sophisticated) approaches might involve Quelpa or =straight.el=.

** usage
   Configure connections just as for other =sql-interactive-mode= products, eg:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
          (add-to-list 'sql-connection-alist
                       '("my databricks connection"
                         (sql-product 'databricks)
                         (sql-server "my-ws.cloud.databricks.com")
                         (sql-http-path "/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
                         (sql-access-token "dapixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")))
   #+end_src

   Then do =M-x sql-connect= and select your connection.
